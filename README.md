# Todo List

It is a simple react js project on Todo list, where we can create, update, and delete out tasks.

Here the data is managed using useSate hook.

```bash
 const [todos, setTodos] = useState({});
```
# Local Storage
I have store the entered data in the local Storage and read the value from there so, that user entered value does not get changed after refreshing it.
